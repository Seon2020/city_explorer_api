City Explorer Back End  
**Author:** Sean Hawkins  
**Version:** 1.0.0
## Overview
This is the back-end for the City Explorer site. I am building it to provide visitors with data on many different locations around the world. It allows users to input a city name and receive several pieces of information: location, weather, and various hiking trails. 

## Getting Started
- git clone
- npm install to install depdendencies
- node server.js to start the server on port 3000
## Architecture
This application is designed for users to enter a city name in the input field towards the top of the page. When a user clicks "Explore", location, weather, restaurant, and hiking data will populate in separate modules below the input field. The language used is JavaScript, with dependencies on: cors, dotenv, express, and nodemon.
